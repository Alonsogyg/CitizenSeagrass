# CitizenSeagrass
With your help we can create a better model to identify seagrass environments and its relation to coastal dynamics


# CitizenSeagrass

## Overview
CitizenSeagrass is a Python application designed for citizen science users to assist in correcting measurements of the Shoreline Monitor. The tool utilizes coastlines imagery to validate the classification of beach types and the presence of seagrass. By doing so, it aims to create a reliable database to assess the correlation between these two phenomena, enhancing our understanding of coastal ecosystems.

## Features
- Displays satellite images of specific coastline locations.
- Allows users to classify the presence of seagrass and types of coastal environments.
- Saves user inputs for further analysis.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Requirements
Before you can run the `CitizenSeagrass` application, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

1. **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. **matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing images.
3. **Pillow**: For image processing.
4. **requests**: For making HTTP requests to the Mapbox API.
5. **ipywidgets**: For creating interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks.
6. **openpyxl**: For reading and writing Excel files (used by pandas).

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib Pillow requests ipywidgets openpyxl
